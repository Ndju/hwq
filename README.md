# About the Application

T/SWBAT is a web application designed to enhance communication and organization between teachers and students. The idea came to us after our English and Computer Science teacher voiced concerns for a lack of an application that consolidated assignments, files, and a calendar in one site. While there were plenty of sites like Google Classroom, Edmodo, TurnItIn, etc. that had some of these features, none were in a consolidated, clean, concise format.

Current functionality gives teachers the ability to create assignments, view it on a calendar, edit the assignment, and even see the student submissions in the submissions query page. Students are able to view their assignments and submit their files. To make sure it has been submitted, they can visit their own submissions query page to make sure their file was received by the database. The sidebar also has tons of functionality: students can select classes to view, join classes, go to the submissions query, change their password, or log out.

The application is runing on Amazon Cloud and currently used by 60+ APCS students and several teachers in Leland HS.

A demo of the application is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUo-R8LoAdY

Our project was built using node.js and is rendered by pjs, an embedded javascript template. We also used jQuery, HTML, and CSS to render the front-end part of our website. The calendar was rendered using our modified version of the rich internet application fullcalendar.io.

In the future, we plan on expanding this project with much more functionality. Teachers would be able to view the different units they are teaching, getting a better idea of how long certain assignments should be. Teachers would be able to upload documents with the assignments they create. Both, students and teachers, would be able to automatically print either class sets or individual papers directly from the website. Moreover, teachers would be able to drag/click to select certain days to “push back” in the event that teachers don’t get to a certain part of their agenda for a day.

This application participated in 2016 Congressional App Challenge and won recognition by Rep. Anna Eshoo.
